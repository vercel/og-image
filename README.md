# Screenshot Capturer

## Usage

### Environment Variables

- `NAVATTIC_CAPTURE_PLAYER_URL` **required** - URL of the Navattic capture player
- `AUTH_SHARED_KEY` **required** - Shared secret key between capture player and this function used to authenticate requests
- `CHROME_PATH` optional - path to chromium/chrome executable. (default based on detected platform)

### Local Development

First make sure you have the vercel CLI installed via `npm install -g vercel`

(Replace environment variables with your values)  
`CHROME_PATH=/usr/bin/chromium NAVATTIC_CAPTURE_PLAYER_URL="http://localhost:8787" vercel dev -l 3001`

Test by going to `http://localhost:3001/api?node_id={some node ID here}` in your browser. After a few seconds you should see a screenshot load on the page.

### Cloud Deployment

Deploy to the cloud by running `vercel` and you'll get a unique URL. You'll need to update the navattic `keys.js` file with the production/staging URLs after deployment.

(Optional) Connect [Vercel for GitHub](https://vercel.com/github) to automatically deploy each time you `git push` ðŸš€

You can make requests to `/api` with the following query string parameters:

- `width` optional - the width in pixels for the capturing viewpoint and resulting image size (default `1200`)
- `height` optional - the height in pixels for the capturing viewpoint and resulting image size (default `800`)
- `response_format` optional - the output format for the screenshot. Accepts values `png` or `json` (default `png`)
